<h1>Coding Conventions and Microsoft C</h1>
<h2>Shared Libraries, DLLs, and Linking</h2>
Similar to UNIX's shared libraries, the Windows world enjoys the freedom
of using dynamically linked libraries (DLLs) to allow programs to access
commonly used functions and runtime support. DLLs, and drivers' .sys files
by extension, are almost identical to a regular windows executable (.exe)
image, except that their code is rarely executed outside of some other
program (see RunDLL32 for the exception). DLLs may be referenced by
other programs at compile-time or run-time, depending on programmer
preference; when a DLL is compiled, all functions labeled as exportable
are added to a table of entry points in a known location of the DLL image.
Another program simply has to name the DLL and the function it wants to
run in order to use the DLL.</p>
<p>
What's so special about DLLs, then? Some would say the best feature is
that only one copy of that binary is loaded into memory. Another benefit
is that even though each DLL may have local variables, those variables are
local to calling program's stack, so two programs using the same functions
will have different stack-local variables. One final feature of DLLs
is that they also may have a 'global' function called DLLMain, which
is run the first time a DLL is mapped into memory (for performing global
initialization); there is a matching unload function.</p>
<h2>Declaring Variables</h2>
<p>Like the original ANSI C, Microsoft's implementation of C requires
that variables only be declared directly after entering a new scope
(the curly braces). Two ways to bypass this rule are 1) start a new scope
when you want to declare a new variable or 2) package your source code in
a C++ compilation unit (i.e. use C++ to compile). While there are various
advantages and disadvantages to both ways, this guide will simply stick
with the original Microsoft C. Note that if you decide to package your
source in a C++ compilation unit, extra steps, such as labeling functions
"extern C" so that the linker recognizes them as exportable, may be
required.
</p> 
<h2>DDK and 'Noise' Words</h2>
<p>
It is important to make sense of certain coding styles that are already
part of the DDK and other Windows driver samples. One major example of
this is the use of words dubbed 'noise' words. Some examples of noise
words are <tt>IN, OUT, UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER, PAGED_CODE</tt>.
<tt>IN</tt> and
<tt>OUT</tt> are simply 'documentation' in that they are #define'd as
nothing, but serve the purpose of labeled which parameters are for
passing-in data to a function and which are for passing-out data. A very
similar practice occurs with <tt>PAGED_CODE();</tt>. Furthermore,
<tt>UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(c)</tt> is used with a variable <tt>c</tt> to
avoid a compile-time warning about never referencing a function parameter
variable. Currently, the Windows DDK defines it as a macro:
"<tt>#define UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(P) (P)</tt>". 
</p><p>Lastly, pay special
attention to the two XP build environments supplied by the DDK. In the 
Checked Build environment, the <tt>DBG</tt> symbol is defined.
Defining that symbol maps the KdPrint macro to DbgPrint. Otherwise, in the
Free Build environment, KdPrint is defined as whitespace. Think about
the consequences of every driver provider shipping the debug version
of their driver while you try to debug your own -- only use the free
build in a production environment. In this guide, we'll use DbgPrint
so that we can use either build (use the Free Build, the checked
build has other consequences).</p>
<p>See ntdef.h for more source-decoration consequences.</p>

<h2>Strings and Unicode</h2> 
<p>

As Windows evolves, it makes the transition from the ANSI character set to
Unicode. ANSI maps to the <tt>char</tt> data type, and Unicode maps to the
<tt>wchar</tt> data type. What follows are some things to know about
strings in Windows programming (which apply to both Win32 and Kernel
code). 

</p> 
<bl>
<li>There are a bunch of compiler macros that allow the use of generic
char types that can be compiled as ANSI or Unicode. The best advice is to
just stick with Unicode fully.</li>
 <li>When initializing Unicode string variables, use the
RtlXxxUnicodeString functions for ALL manipulation of string variables.
All!</li>
<li>Unicode string literals are preceeded by an L. <tt>L"Hello"</tt>
is a valid wchar (Unicode) literal.</li>
<li>The Microsoft C compiler concatenates all string literals placed in a
series. Thus <tt>L"Hello" L"Student"</tt> is functionally equivalent to
<tt>L"HelloStudent"</tt>.
 <li>Don't get fooled into making assumptions about
how many characters are in a byte; Unicode has codepoints, which are not
entirely opaque.</li>
<li>Unicode is often locale specific. Don't be surprised when your driver
strings don't work in locales where reading is done right to left.</li>
</bl>
<h2>Use MSDN Library on CD or Online</h2>
<p>The Microsoft Developers Network Library is your best resource. It
is well-maintained, up to date, and historically quite accurate. Also, 
it has some fun 'easter eggs' that relieve tension during a
high-stress debugging session. Realize that it documents the Platform
SDK as well (user-mode) -- make sure you look at what section you're
reading from, and don't hesitate to browse another section to get an
idea of what a user-mode program might do when wanting to perform the
same function you are attempting to perform.</p> 
<h2>And the fine print about all APIs and system internals</h2>
<p><b>If it isn't documented, it's subject to change.</b> If examine
entry points in common system DLLs and drivers, as well as DDK header
files, you will notice a wealth of other 'internal' and 'undocumented' 
features in the XP kernel. It is in your best interest not to use any
of the undocumented functionality because it is subject to change AND
may require synchronization/mutual exclusion your code cannot provide.</p>
