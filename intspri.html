<h1>Interrupts</h1>
<h2>Interrupt Dispatching</h2>
<p>
By using interrupt driven I/O, a processor doesn't have to continually
wait in a busy loop for I/O operations to complete -- devices can generate
an interrupt in hardware to notify the Windows OS that they need service.
While there are alternatives, such as polling and direct memory access,
most printers, keyboards, disk-drives and network cards use
interrupt based I/O. Typically, this functionality is supported through an
interrupt controller that services hardware interrupts after Windows fills
an array of function pointers during the boot process. Through the
HAL and a platform-dependent interrupt controller in hardware, Windows'
plug and play manager handles interrupt assignments, where interrupts may 
be shared by more than one device. When these interrupts occur, the CPU
control is transferred to an Operating System function called a dispatch
function which provides service or delegates to code that can. It must 
also determine, if the interrupt is shared, which device actually
caused the interrupt.</p> 
<h2>Software Interrupts and Handling</h2>
<p>In Windows XP, more than just an I/O device's requests for service can
generate an interrupt. The kernel can use 'software interrupts' to perform
scheduling, handle page faults, handle the expiration of a time slice, or 
asynchronously execute procedures in the context of a particular thread.
For handling most software interrupts, the kernel
uses an interrupt object that can be interrogated by drivers to provide
service to interrupting devices. During some interrupt handling the kernel
also disables all other interrupts, which then will remain until handled. 
In Windows XP, these interrupts are mapped into software interrupt request
levels (IRQLs) -- but not all IRQLs correspond to interrupts.</p>
<h2>IRQLs and Interrupt Objects</h2>
<p>What follows is a diagram of the x86 IRQL-model:<br />
<center><img src="images/irqls.gif"/></center>
</p>
<p>
In the IRQL scheme, any higher level IRQL may interrupt any lower level
IRQL (lower levels are masked when the system is at a higher IRQL). Most
device drivers will operate at DPC/Dispatch, APC, or Passive level. The
kernel uses the High IRQL during a BugCheck (a blue screen of death) or
when masking all interrupts. Kernel profiling level is used when kernel
profiling is turned on to measure kernel performance. Device
interrupts occur somewhere between dispatch/DPC and the profiling
level. Clock level is used for tracking time quantums, time/process
accounting,  and scheduling (think about why a multiprocessor system
might need this synchronization in scheduling). DPC and APC levels are
used for software interrupts, and will be explained later.</p> 
<p>One important thing to remember as a driver writer is that any code
executing at or above DPC/Dispatch level must not activate scheduling code
in the kernel since the scheduler uses dispatch level to synchronize
access to data structures. One major indirect result is that code at
dispatch or higher may also not cause page faults, as this would cause
rescheduling to the memory manager. When drivers violate these or other
rules about working with IRQLs, Windows immediately calls KeBugCheck (see
MSDN) and creates the blue screen of death and halts the system.</p>
<p>Finally, the kernel uses Interrupt Objects for saving the mapping from
a device's interrupt to its IRQL, storing interrupt service routine
pointers, and allowing drivers to register dispatch routines for device
interrupts.
The most important use of interrupt objects is by the generic kernel
dispatcher routine that handles all interrupt dispatching -- the
generic routine typically pulls a pointer to a driver's dispatch
routine out of the object and then calls this (secondary) dispatcher. Like
many other kernel data structures, Interrupt Objects are object-oriented
but are still implemented with C code.</p>
<h2>Deferred/Dispatch Procedure Calls and Asynchronous Procedure Calls</h2>
<p>Dispatch procedure calls are a process by which the kernel defers
thread dispatching while the kernel is in
the midst of another task. This must be deferred because the
kernel is often servicing an interrupt at an IRQL greater than
DPC/Dispatch level but detects that rescheduling is needed. These dispatch
procedure calls are a convienent way defer a non-time critical
but important task. Similarly, deferred procedure calls enable other
kernel-code (including device drivers) a way to postpone execution
until a later time. The kernel uses DPCs to process timer expiration (the 
system clock),
wake threads waiting on timers or other kernel objects or
synchronization mechanisms, among many other tasks. Device drivers use 
DPCs to schedule the handling of I/O completion without spending a ton 
of time at the device's interrrupting IRQL -- devices can acknowledge
an interrupt and schedule a call to an I/O completion routine later
.</p>
<p>Similar, asynchronous procedure calls are a more advanced version
of the DPCs discussed above. These are routines that can be scheduled
to execute in the context of a particular thread, and at an IRQL <
dispatch/dpc level (the APC level). The advantage of code being called at
this lower IRQL is that it may incur page faults, use system services, 
and have access to a specific thread context. Unlike the systemwide DPC
queue, each thread has its own APC queue. Device drivers use the APC
mechanism to return to a thread that requested an I/O operation after
the operation has completed; the device driver code, in the context of
the thread that initiated the I/O request, can fill a
user-mode addressed buffer with the returned I/O data. APCs are also
used to suspend threads from execution until a particular event occurs,
and then an APC is scheduled by the event's callback function.</p> 

<h1>Windows Scheduling</h1> 
<p>In Windows, the thread is the basic unit of execution. Each process has
one or more threads, and may have just one thread. Each process has a
block of memory which contains many fields of information about the
process, as well as pointers to blocks of information about each
individual thread. Each thread has it's own stack and execution
context within the process address space; each thread is also the
basic unit of Windows Scheduling. Within the kernel, the work of the
'scheduler' is actually distributed and there is no 'one' unit that
directs the task of scheduling threads. This section will not go into all
of the possible scheduling scenarios in detail, but it is important as a
driver writer to be aware of what the kernel dispatcher is doing when
your code is called.</p> 
<h2>Thread States and the System Idle Thread</h2>
<p><img src="images/threadst.gif" /></p>
<ol start="0">
<li>Init: Used by the kernel during process creation</li>
<li>Ready: Any thread marked as ready will be considered by the
dispatcher for execution; when no threads are ready, the system
schedules the "system idle thread," which is really just an idle loop
checking for DPCs and APCs to be called </li> 
<li>Running: The one thread that is actually executing</li>
<li>Standby: The one thread that is scheduled and next in line for
execution; note that a thread in this state may still be preempted</li>
<li>Terminate: Any thread that has completed execution, but who's
thread block or kernel-allocated space for objects has not yet been
freed</li>
<li>Waiting: Any thread that is waiting for an operation to complete, 
either voluntarily or involuntarily</li>
<li>Transition: This state is reserved for threads that are ready to
execute but whose kernel stack has been paged out of memory</li>
</ol>
<h2>Priority Levels and Realtime</h2>
<p>Windows XP has priority values numbered 0 through 31 for threads,
where 31 is the highest and 0 is the lowest. Priority values from 16 to 31
are reserved for "real time" threads, and threads at those levels may
interefere with system threads' ability to perform critical system tasks.
Note that real time is not used in the traditional sense here -- XP is not
technically a real time OS and real time here means the same as the
priority of a kernel-mode thread. As an added feature, users must have an
extra privledge to raise a thread to a realtime priority, but don't need
that privledge to change priorities within the dynamic time range
(explanation of dynamic time priorities follows). Priority values from
1 to 15 are for "dynamic time" threads, which are used by most user-mode
applications and some others as well. The 0 priority is reserved for a
single system thread that zeros out free memory pages when no other work
in the system needs to be performed. </p>
<h2>Interrupt Levels versus Priority Levels</h2>
<p>Threads will normally always execute at IRQL = Passive or IRQL = APC
(that is, thread priority 31 is still lower priority than the dispatch/DPC
IRQL). Under that limitation, threads will never block a hardware
interrupt, but may block software interrupts and kernel-threads that
handle DPCs queued during an interrupt. Kernel threads and realtime
ones may operate specifically at IRQL = APC whereas user-mode threads
(except the realtime ones) will operate at passive level IRQL. As a driver writer, you should
know that system threads will always invoke the DriverEntry routine (the
first time any device is loaded that uses your device) within a system
thread at passive level; all driver dispatch routines will be called at
DPC/dispatch level or higher, as they may be a result of interrupts (this 
also means that the kernel's dispatch routines, which may call your
dispatch routines, can arbitrarily raise and lower the IRQL as needed to
synchronize access to protected kernel data structures). When
working within kernel mode inside a driver, there is a KeGetCurrentIRQL
routine (again, this is documented on the MSDN library) that can be called
to verify the IRQL your code is running at.</p>
<h2>Quantum and Priority Boosting</h2>
<p>In Windows XP, a single time quantum is usually three times the
system clock interval, and the overhead that sets this up usually
occurs through calls to the HAL. In Windows XP, threads usually for 2
quantums (but in Windows Server environments, they usually run longer
to minimize the overhead of context switching). Keep in mind, however, 
that threads may be preempted during their quantum, and they may still 
have their quantum deducted without actually getting a chance to
execute (if threads preempted for a dispatcher never got their
quantum deducted, they would never complete their quantum, and system
interrupts would never allow the thread to exhaust its quantum =
deadlock).</p>
<p>The important part of this discussion related to drivers is 
the idea of quantum boosting: a thread will get its quantum multiplied 
by some factor each time some 'favorable' event occurs due to the
thread. Quantum boosting is an elegant alternative to priority
boosting, because raising a priority for a thread that does something
good will eventually reach the max priority, and competition between
two threads who both earn a priority boost isn't very productive in
terms of system behavior. One type of quantum boosting occurs when a
thread is brought into the foreground of the GUI; in this case, a
thread's quantum is doubled or tripled each time it is brought into
the foreground. </p><p>When there is high contention for the CPU, this
method 
very accurately leverages an appropriate scheduling scheme because
a thread's quantum expnonentially increases the more it is brought to the
foreground -- this is not the case if priorities are continually raised.
Other types of quantum boosting include boosting for threads that
voluntarily block, complete an I/O request (this one is reflected in
function call arguments to complete driver I/O requests by allowing the
driver to offer a quantum boost for the thread), CPU starvation, waiting
for synchronization events, or for threads that own windows when the GUI
is activated (or reactivated). Quantum boosting is one of many elegant 
schemes that allows XP to be fully responsive to the user, the user's
devices, and system services. It may be interesting to note that many
of the Windows Server systems have some different variations of
'quantum management' and most use larger quantums and don't boost as
much for GUI-related threads.</p>
