<h2>User Mode Drivers</h2>
<p>User-mode "drivers" mostly open hardware through a kernel-mode
driver, often providing some service to user mode programs that is
then translated into a call into a kernel mode driver. The most common 
example of this is a printer driver that translates device-independent
calls into device-specific ones. Another example is a driver that
simple provides a callable interface in order to virtualize direct
hardware access from older DOS mode programs that were written
expecting direct hardware access.</p>

<h3>File System Drivers</h3> 
File System drivers typically re-queue and issue reads and writes to
another driver (such as a network or mass-storage device). This type of
driver often provides a translation from filename to physical location as
well.

<h3>Plug and Play Drivers</h3>
<p>
Plug and Plug drivers are device drivers in the most classical sense of
the word -- they drive everything from video adapaters to mass storage
devices. They integrate with the Power Manager and the Plug and Plug (PnP)
Manager to provide the best possible user experience during installation
and usage. Typically, Plug and Play is synonymous with the Windows
Driver Model.</p>

<h4>Windows Driver Model (WDM)</h4>
<p>The Windows Driver Model (WDM) is the primary focus of this guide. The
WDM is a strongly-recommended way to create device drivers that will work
with 98/Me, 2000, and XP. It is supported through a framework provided by
the XP Kernel (often called the Executive). WDM Drivers are
implemented using a layered approach where each driver implements 
a layer that I/O requests and results must pass through on the
journey from user-mode to physical hardware. Microsoft provides many
facilities for driving devices under the WDM, and makes it difficult to 
successfully drive devices without the WDM. WDM drivers typically fall 
into three categories.</p>
<a name="busdrivers"/>
<h5>Bus drivers</h5>
<p>
Bus drivers detect and manage devices on a physical bus plugged into the
system. Typical buses include PCI, ISA, PCMIA, USB, and IEEE 1294
(Firewire). The primary role of a bus driver is to enumerate devices 
plugged in to the bus and inform the PnP Manager of their existence. It
also typically manages power settings of the devices and the bus itself
through the Power Manager.</p>
<a name="functiondrivers"/>
<h5>Function drivers</h5>
<p>
Function drivers handle the operation of a particular device or type of
device. A device is presented to the function driver from a bus driver via
the PnP Manager. Function drivers typically know the most about the device
they control and bear the closest resemblance to a non-layer
monolithic device driver.</p> 
<a name="filterdrivers"/>
<h5>Filter drivers</h5>
<p>Filter drivers exist above or below function drivers. They filter
information flowing from the function driver to the bus driver, and
vice-versa. The I/O Subsystem of Windows XP is packet based, and filter
drivers typically manipulate those packets as well as deleting and
creating packets. For filtering input device drivers, filter drivers
typically intercept the hooking mechanism in a plug and play IRP and
install their own dispatch callback function.

<h3>Class, Port, and Miniport Drivers</h3> <p>
There is one other classification of WDM drivers, in which three
categories exist. Class Drivers are function drivers for devices that have
a standardized interface, for which one driver can operate devices from a
variety of manufacturers. Port drivers map I/O requests into a specific
kind of port, such as RS232 or SCSI. Port drivers are typically a
kernel-mode library that creates port-specific I/O requests from generic
ones. Finally, Miniport drivers continue mapping where a Port driver
leaves off -- miniport drivers take a port-type-specific I/O request and
actually drive a device. Miniport drivers know things that are device
specific such as which location on a serial interface handles a specific
function of a device. It may be helpful to consider that a Port Driver + a
Miniport Driver sum, in functionality, to a Function Driver.

<h3>Non-Plug and Play Drivers</h3>
<p>
Non-Plug and Play drivers are sometimes also referred to as
Kernel-extensions. These often provide a new API to user-mode components
to get a novel functionality out of kernel-mode services. These extensions
add everything from encryption to new network protocol APIs. </p>
