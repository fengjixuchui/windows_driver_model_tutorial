<h1>WDM Driver (Data) Structures</h1>
<p>This section is introduces some of the data structures used in Windows
drivers as well as how they are linked together to create a larger
structure, which in turn provides a lot of functionality for device
drivers. Your best resource in this section is the DDK (look up each
object and struct) and the first three chapters of Oney's
<u>Programming the Windows Driver Model</u>. It is critical during initial
driver routines that these structures are allocated, linked together, and
accessed properly to avoid crashing the system (null pointers,
malformed linked lists, etc).</p>
<h2>Driver and Device Objects</h2>
<h3>Quick Overview, Graphically</h3>

 <h3>Driver Objects</h3>
<p>Similar to the device object structure, the I/O manager uses a
<tt>DRIVER_OBJECT</tt> structure to represent each device driver. Again,
like the device object structure, this structure is also partially opaque.
Make sure you check the DDK reference for the structure before you write
code that directly modifies any fields of any of these partially-opaque
structures. The driver object is the place where function pointers to all
your driver's routines are stored. The driver object contains a pointer to
the first device object and also a pointer to the driver extension (the
extension stores the pointer to the AddDevice routine for your driver).
You'll see in the Device Object structure that a similar 'extension'
exists for devices, and that is where any state information specific to a
device can be stored. </p>
<p>
The I/O Manager also maintains a linked list of devices, with
the head of the list pointed to by DriverObject's DeviceObject field. You
won't ever modify this list directly unless you are writing a legacy
driver which must traverse the list and delete each device object when the
driver is unloading. You will call the function
<tt>IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStack</tt> to link </p> 
<h3>Device Objects</h3> <p>
Windows XP's Plug and Play manager recursively enumerates device objects
from a 'root' device object, down through specific buses, all the way up
to functional device objects. When each device object is
'discovered,' some driver's AddDevice is called which fully creates
each device object. Each of these device objects is known in the driver
world by specific abbreviations, though this won't affect the kind of
driver we are creating:
<ol>
<li>PDO - a physical device object representing connection from bus
to a device</li>
<li>FDO - a function device object, used by function drivers to
manage device functionality</li>
<li>FiDO - a filter device object used by WDM filter drivers to store
information about hardware</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The above three 'types' of device objects are defined in the DDK through a
partially-opaque structure (the kernel reserves the sole right to use some
of the members of the structure) <tt>DEVICE_OBJECT</tt>. <b>Devices are
said to be 'stacked' because each device object contains a pointer (via
the <TT>AttachedDevice</tt> member, opaque to drivers) to the device
object immediately above it</b> (there is no place, by default, to store a
pointer to the device object below, but drivers can do this by creating
their own storage spot). Once this upwardly-linked device stack is created
by the PNP Manager, it is best that drivers do not alter it. 
</p><p>WDM provides
functions such as <tt>IoGetAttachedDeviceReference</tt> to figure out what
device object is on the top of the stack and
<tt>IoAttachDeviceToStack</tt> in a driver's AddDevice routine to add
the newly created DeviceObject to the old stack (see the MSDN page on that
function for other utility functions).
Device objects may store pointers to the driver object (below), the next
device in the stack, the most recent I/O request packet sent to your
device, a device extension, device-specific characteristics, and more.
</p>
<p>The final thing stored inside a device object is the device extension
(<TT>DEVICE_EXTENSION, PDEVICE_EXTENSION</tt>). This is a structure the
driver writer creates that can store pointers and data on a per-device
object basis. Any space you allocate in <tt>DriverEntry</tt> and then
store a pointer to in your device extension must also be freed at some
point (DriverUnload, perhaps?). The Device Extension is the prime place to
store information such as pointers to above and below you in the stack,
registry key values or locations, as well as runtime settings for your
device. </p>

Note that a device may play the role of both a functional device and a
primary device object where other devices are rooted.</p>
