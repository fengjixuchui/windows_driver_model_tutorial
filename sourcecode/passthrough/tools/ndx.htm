<h1>
Tools for Loading your Driver
</h1>
<p>This provides you, the user, some way to get the system to load
your driver. You must (a) create a service entry for your driver and
(b) specify that service name as an upper filter of the mouclass
service.</p>

The files:
<ol>
<li><a href="RegisterDriverService.cpp">RegisterDriverService.cpp</a></li>
<li><a href="MouFiltrServiceDescription.reg">MouFiltrServiceDescription.reg</a></li>
<li><a href="rds.exe">rds.exe</a></li>
<li>Use RegEdit to edit the registry, and Visual Studio to compile the
executable.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What does it do</h2>
<p>
Both the .reg file and executable add a new service entry called
"moufiltr." Even if you use one of these files, you must still open
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E96F-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}
and modify the value of "UpperFilters" to include "moufiltr" BEFORE
mouclass. It should read "moufiltr\0mouclass\0\0" -- treat \0 as a newline
in the registry editor. </p>
