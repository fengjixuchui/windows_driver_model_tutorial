<h2>What does it do</h2>
<p>This driver uses a new function MouFilter_MakeSynchronousIoctl to call
the API function IoBuildDeviceIoControlRequest and prints debug
messages. This driver creates a new IRP (of function code
IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL) when the device is added. The driver
blocks the system thread that loads it until the new IRP is
completed, and our driver prints out the results of
the minor function code IOCTL_MOUSE_QUERY_ATTRIBUTES. Don't forget to run

<h2>How to build</h2>
<p>
After installing the DDK, open the build environment "Windows XP Free
Build." Change to the directory with these files, then execute
"build.exe." The build utility should be automatically in your path. 
</p>

<h2>How to Install</h2>
<ol>
<li>Copy the .sys file generated from the build into the \System32\Drivers
folder of the Windows XP Root</li>
<li>Modify the HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services to introduce a new
key named "MouFiltr". -- You probably already did this in previous
examples.</li> 
<li>Open 
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E96F-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}
and modify the value of "UpperFilters" to include "moufiltr" BEFORE
mouclass. It should read "moufiltr\0mouclass\0\0" -- treat \0 as a
newline in the registry editor. You probably already did this in a
previous example.</li> </ol>

<h2>What is each file</h2>
<ol>
<li>makefile only points to the DDK's default build scripts</li>
<li>sources contains a list of files to be included during
compilation</li>
<li>kbdmou.h is from the ddk and includes useful structures and #defines
used in the driver</li>
<li>moufiltr.rc has information about the driver, it's filename,
description, and version structure</li>
<li>moufiltr.h and .c are the headers and code for the driver</li>
</ol>
