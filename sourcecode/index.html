<p><IMG SRC="/icons/folder.gif" ALT="[DIR]">
<A HREF="helloworld/">helloworld/</A> - This example driver is not
associated with a stack and handles no data; it contains no I/O
handling and simple prints messages to the kernel debug print buffer.</p>

<p><IMG SRC="/icons/folder.gif" ALT="[DIR]"> <A
HREF="passthrough/">passthrough/</A> - This is the proof of concept
that simply passes information through the stack, viewing but not
modifying any mouse data</p> 

<p><IMG SRC="/icons/folder.gif" ALT="[DIR]">
<A HREF="invertaxis/">invertaxis/</A> - This example inverts the X and Y
coordinates of mouse input</p>

<p><IMG SRC="/icons/folder.gif" ALT="[DIR]"> <A
HREF="scalefast/">scalefast/</A> - This example scales mouse relative
distances by a factor of 10 on each axis</p>

<p><IMG SRC="/icons/folder.gif" ALT="[DIR]"> <A HREF="unitid/">unitid/</A> 
- This reports a unique but unused ID of each USB mouse, as enumerated 
by a lower driver; it demonstrates one method for differentiating
different mice in the system.</p> 

<p><IMG SRC="/icons/folder.gif" ALT="[DIR]"> <A
HREF="queryattr/">queryattr/</A> - This demonstrates creating and passing
a synchronous IRP down to the driver below (and further) and waiting for a
reply. It queries mouse attribites with an IO Control Code.</p>

<HR>
Each directory should contain everything you need to build each sample, as
well as some explanation of what the code does.
