<h1>
The Hello World Driver
</h1>
<p>This driver just prints debug messages. Don't forget to run the
better <a
href="http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/DebugView.html">DbgView</a>
(from <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/">sysinternals.com</a>)!</p>

The files:
<ol>
<li><a href="hello.c">hello.c</a></li>
<li><a href="makefile">makefile</a></li>
<li><a href="sources">sources</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>What does it do</h2>
<p>This example has NO functionality other than to be loaded and
unloaded. When it is loaded and unloaded, it deposits a print
statement into the kernel's debug print buffer. This example is best
run by using the Win32 API or the utility mentioned below. Also run
DbgView so that you can see the print statements in that Kernel 
buffer.</p>
<h2>How to build</h2> <p>
After installing the DDK, open the build environment "Windows XP Free
Build." Change to the directory with these files, then execute
"build.exe." The build utility should be automatically in your path. 
</p>

<h2>How to Install</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create a usermode program that uses the API calls CreateService and
StartService (see MSDN library).</li>
<li>Use OSR's <a
href="http://www.osronline.com/article.cfm?article=157">Driver
Loader</a> Utility instead of writing your own</li>
</ol>

<h2>What is each file</h2>
<ol>
<li>makefile only points to the DDK's default build script</li>
<li>sources contains a list of files to be included during compilation</li>
<li>hello.c are the headers and code for the driver</li>
</ol>
