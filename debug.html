<h1>Debugging Your Driver</h1>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>At a minimum, you'll want to be able to use the following tools for
debugging drivers:</p>
<ol>
<li><a
href="http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/DebugView.html">DebugView</a>
from <a
href="http://www.sysinternals.com/">http://www.sysinternals.com/</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/default.mspx">Debugging
Tools for Windows</a>, which includes WinDbg, the Kernel
Debugger</li>
<li>The Driver Verifier, which comes with the DDK</li>
<li>Internet Access for the <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/debugstart.mspx">Microsoft
Symbol Server</a> OR the appropriate <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/DevTools/Debugging/symbolpkg.mspx">Windows
System Package</a> for your Operating System.</li>
</ol> 
<h2>Print Statement Method</h2>
<p>
The classic debugging technique is simply using print statements to output
the values of variables where you expect a problem is occuring. You'll
note that DbgPrint and the other KdPrint macros use printf-style
string formatting and you may include variables in your debug output.
You'll want to be especially careful though, and check in MSDN what your
output data type *should* be, as printf-style formatting may require you
to specify not just integer, but long integer, unsigned integer, short 
integer, or some other combination of quantifiers. You may simply run
the DbgView program to have it read from the kernel debug print
buffer. If you'd like to see debug print statements in the kernel
debugger, read on.</p>

<h2>Enabling Crash Dumps</h2> 
<p>You'll want to enable crash dumps if you have a driver that causes
the blue screen of death (i.e. a kernel 'bug check'). There are three
different styles of memory dumps, and Windows XP always creates a
minidump, whether you like it or not. The three different types of
memory dumps are: <ol><li>Small Memory Dump (Minidump)</li><li>Kernel
Memory Dump</li><li>Complete Memory Dump</li></ol>When your system bug
checks, it will show you an error message, along with a bugcheck
'code' that may or may not give some insight into the cause of the
error. It will also offer a guess (in the form of a file name) as to which
driver caused the error. If you have any of the memory dumps enabled,
the system will also dump the requested amount of memory into the system's 
pagefile. Finally, it will halt the system.</p> 
<p>You'll need a pagefile at least as large as the memory dump you have
requested the system to perform. For a complete memory dump, if you have
1024 mb of RAM, you'll need a pagefile at least a gigabyte in size!
For the small memory dump, you'll need 64 K (you probably have a
pagefile at least double this size). For the Kernel memory dump,
you'll need somewhere in between, depending on how much of the kernel
is in memory at the time of a crash.</p>
<p>To enable crash dumps, visit the "System" icon in the Control Panel,
and click on the Advanced tab. Under "Startup and Recovery," choose
the "Settings" button. At the bottom of the window, you'll see a drop down
list where you may select one of the crash dump types, along with
where to store it. When the system boots after a crash, it will
extract the dump from the system's pagefile and write it to the
specified location.</p>

 <h2>The Kernel Debugger (WinDbg)</h2>
<p>While the kernel debugger may seem arcane, it has a very good automated
system for crash dump analysis. It also now allows you to debug the
kernel while it is running. After installing the kernel debugger,
you'll notice a program called "Global Flags" in the same program
group. Run that first, and check flags like "Buffer DbgPrint Output"
in each tabbed pane. Once you've done that, go ahead and open the
debugger.</p>
<p>First, let's set up the symbols in the debugger. From the File menu,
select "Symbol Path." If you downloaded and installed the symbols into
<tt>C:\Directory</tt>, you'll want to enter that path into the dialog box.
If you'd like to have the Kernel Debugger download them from Microsoft 
into C:\Directory as needed, enter
<tt>SRV*C:\Directory*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols</tt> 
 as your symbol path. Microsoft offers the use of the symbol server
for free to one and all, and that server has symbols for most of its
major operating systems. Click okay to leave the symbol path dialog box,
and you're ready to debug! </p>
<p>
To open a crash dump, select "Open Crash Dump" from the File menu. It will
create a new workspace where you may have to re-enter the symbol server
information -- "the crash dump workspace." Save the symbol server
preferences by saving the workspace, once you have the symbol path setup
correctly. Check out <a href="debug1.txt">sample
output</a> from a Kernel Memory Dump opened in WinDbg. I've also included
the following screenshot of the output. Note the command prompt.
</p>

<p>In this instance, the debugger's automated analysis has decided the
crash was probably caused by naiavf5x.sys, a kernel filter driver for some
popular virus scanning software. Following the debugger's suggestion, we
can type "!analyze -v" for a <a href="debug2.txt">detailed analysis</a>
(see the output).
<p>Yikes! It sounds like somewhere we had some corrupted memory in the
kernel. This type of error could be caused by any number of hidden sources
that accidentally touched memory they shouldn't have. Notice that the
debugger will show you a stack of trace of what functions had stack
entries (the call order) during the crash, along with other information
like a more descriptive error code (BAD_POOL_HEADER) and the address of
the memory violation.
</p>
<p>
Some other useful commands for analyzing your crash dump are: 
!drivers, !kdext*.locks, !memusage, !vm, !errlog, !process 0 0,
and !process 0 7. Check out the section titled "Analyzing a Kernel-Mode
Dump File with WinDbg" in the Debugger's help for even more commands.
 The help files included with the Kernel Debugger also provide a huge
resource of bugcheck codes, error code descriptions, and commands for
analyzing all sorts of things. Note that you can attach the debugger
to other things like executable images and live kernels, though that
is probably out of the scope of this guide.</p>
