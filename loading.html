<h1>Loading Drivers &amp; the Registry</h1>
<h2>What does the registry do?</h2>
<p>Most generally, the Windows registry is where the operating system stores most setting/state
information as well as where it provides a Window to the kernel (not unlike NFS's /proc). The
Plug and Play Manager, the Shell, and Setup APIs/programs all rely heavily on the registry for
everything from booting the machine to determining file types. While not covered here, the
techniques used to maintain the registry are quite elegant and not unlike a simplified relational
database. The registry is also a major player in the game of how device drivers get loaded by the
system, and that is where we focus our attention in this guide. To edit or view the registry as
you follow along, run the RegEdit.exe program from Start -> Run. The keys described here are all
children of the <em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</em> branch of the tree.</p> 
<h2>A Visual Representation of relevant Keys</h2>
<img alt="" src="images/regkeys.gif"/>
<h2>Hardware (Instance) Key</h2>
<p><em>\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum</em></p>
<p>This key contains subkeys for all of the 'enumerable' buses in the system. You'll find that each
enumerable device's hardware key is a subkey of the bus's key that it belongs to. Drilling down
further, each hardware ID also has subkeys containing hardware instance keys for each instance of
that device. This structure of hardware keys stores a lot of details about the device (the Device
Manager in User Mode gets its information directly from this key) including the manufacterer, a
friendly name, resource requirements, and the device's class key. This section can also be
directly accessed by user mode programs and WDM drivers.</p>
<h2>Class Key and Our Filter Example</h2>
<p><em>\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class</em></p>
<p>This section is pointed to by the hardware key for each device. Information found in this
subkey applies to all devices within a class, which is identified by a Class ID. The one that
applies here to us is the one for pointing devices, which is represented textually as
{4D36E96F-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}. These keys for each device class contain other
information as well, such as what filter drivers should be loaded for all devices in this class.
We'll be using this key to add our filter driver for all mice. This location was chosen so that
anyone using this guide could filter their mouse device without having to scout around for the
device key for their specific mouse.</p>
<p>
It is necessary to mention that the key
<em>\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E96F-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}</em> contains an
entry called UpperFilters, of type REG_SZ_MULTI. This is one of two entries we'll be modifying to
load our device. The syntax of the REG_SZ_MULTI data type is tricky depending on where you are (in a
user mode program or the registry). For our purposes, you may simply put a newline between subsequent
driver service names in the list, and an extra newline at the end. If you're loading one of the
filter drivers provided in this example, you'll want upperfilters to read: "moufiltr \newline
mouclass \newline \newline" where \newline is exactly one new line. Make sure moufiltr is listed
before mouclass, or the driver won't be in the correct position in the stack! </p>
<h2>Driver Key &amp; Serice Key</h2>
<p><em>\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{class id}\001...\...</em></p>
<p>To be more specific, each device has a numbered key below the class key mentioned above. Most
of the device-specific information below the class key is simply information about how to find a
driver or INF file for installation and setup purposes. We won't be modifying it at all, though
you may be interested in browsing it on your own system.</p> 
<p><em>\System\CurrentControlSet\Services</em><p>
<p>The service key is the second important location that you'll need to add to or modify to load
our driver examples. This key has subkeys that 'name' each driver (a driver is considered a
service by the service control manager, but not in the typical sense of 'NT service') and govern
how it is loaded. Each named subkey of the services key corresponds to the name in the
UpperFilter's entry in the class key, and each service subkey for a driver contains information
like the location of the .sys file on disk and parameters that affect the order in which the
driver is loaded. We'll be adding a subkey of services called moufiltr for our examples, but
there's often a simpler way to do this, which I'll mention in the next section.</p>
<h2>Service Control Manager</h2>
<p>Plainly stated, the SCM is in charge of that services subkey mentioned above. To modify anything
therein, I recommend calling on the SCM to modify everything for you. I've included a simple Win32
User Mode program for you to use that will add a given service to the service key by way of the SCM.
My advice would be to trust the SCM, as it knows more about it's registry keys than we do. The sample
code is called RegisterDriverService.cpp and you'll find it among the annotated drivers. If you
really, really want to add the service subkey for our driver examples by hand, you'll need to use
MSDN to look up what entries are required (there are a ton!). The relevant settings we'll use for our
service include, at a minimum, the following (given in the format of the arguments to call the SCM,
as in MSDN):
<blockquote><pre>
	lpDisplayName = L"DriverServiceName";
	dwDesiredAccess = SC_MANAGER_CREATE_SERVICE;
	dwServiceType = SERVICE_KERNEL_DRIVER;
	dwStartType = SERVICE_SYSTEM_START;
	dwErrorControl = SERVICE_ERROR_NORMAL;
	lpBinaryPathName = L"\System32\Drivers\filename.sys";
	lpLoadOrderGroup = NULL;
	lpdwTagId = NULL;
	lpDependencies = NULL;
	lpServiceStartName = NULL;
	lpPassword = NULL;
</pre></blockquote>
</p> 
<h2>LastKnownGood and Finishing Up</h2> 
<p>Armed with the above information, you're ready to load sample
drivers into a system! The examples themselves often include .reg
files or some usermode utility's sourcecode for loading the driver. If 
we didn't need to load our examples into a stack with the mice-related 
drivers, we'd probably just load the driver using Win32 APIs.</p>
<p>What happens if you have a driver that crashes the system and it
gets loaded when the system is booted? Don't dismay -- the system
copies everything below <tt>\System\CurrentControlSet</tt> into a
backup controlset after each successful boot (boot + user login).
Don't modify the other control sets under \System, because they may
save you if need to recover your driver configuration after adding a
bad driver into the load order. You can probably bet that the current
contol set is really just a symlink to ControlSetXXX. To restore your
system to a 'working' driver set, hit F8 as the boot sequence starts,
and choose "Last Known Good..." from the list -- that will restore you 
to a working control set.</p>
