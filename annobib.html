<h2>Windows XP &amp; the Windows Driver Model - Annotated
Bibliography</h2>
<ol>
<li>Baker, Art, and Jerry Lozano. <u>The Windows 2000 Device Driver
Book</u>. 2nd ed. New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 2001.
<p>While this book may seem somewhat archaic (WDM content was added after
the first edition), it covers many topics that are unmentioned in later
and more comprehensive works that cover Windows driver development.
Particularly, this book covers hardware &amp; buses (especially the USB),
stress testing, and practical details of crash dump debugging. Some have
also called this book a better version of the DDK, and I would consider it 
a good book to start from. It offers perspective into pre-WDM drivers
and a better focus on hardware, but has a limited scope such that isn't
found other other texts.</p> </li>
<li>Hart, Johnson M. <u>Win32 System Programming</u>. 2nd ed. Indiana:
Addison-Wesley, 2001.
<p>The text isn't directly related to driver development and the
Windows Driver Model, but developers who are new to kernel-mode
programming can make good use of a reference into the Win32 API.
Furthermore, seeing
how user-mode will call drivers is supremely useful in understanding the
kernel behind the scenes. This book also has excellent coverage of general
Windows issues such as Unicode support and security objects. As the author
states, this book is written with a UNIX audience in mind and makes many
equivalence comparisons between UNIX system calls and the Win32 API.
For developers coming from a UNIX background, I would highly recommend
this book before reading driver development books.</p></li>
<li>Oney, Walter. <u>Programming the Microsoft Windows Driver Model</u>.
2nd ed. Redmond: Microsoft Press, 2003.
<p>While this book is the flagship of Microsoft Press's WDM coverage, I
would not recommend it without some prior readings into the Windows Driver
Model. The author does do an excellent job of highlighting some critical
but confusing issues and offers precise solutions to these problems,
though most casual or new users won't really understand these problems to 
begin with. This book also has excellent coverage of how the WDM is
implemented on the gamut of Windows platforms, and how to maintain
compatibility between them. Lastly, this book has excellent coverage of
filter drivers in the WDM and a great section on how to get hardware and
drivers Windows-logo certified. </p> </li> 
<li>Russinovich, Mark E., and David A. Solomon. <u>Microsoft Windows
Internals: <i>Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows
2000</i></u>. 4th ed. Redmond: Microsoft Press, 2005.
<p>Russinovich and Solomon are venerated leaders of the Windows line of
operating systems and have created a rich documentation that brings order
into what can often seem a very chaotic internal OS environment.
This work is unparalleled in its concision and clarity of the
latest Windows systems. This was the best reference I had for
general OS internals that were related to driver development and
provided a background for much of the material in WDM and Windows 
Driver Development Books. The I/O system coverage is also superb.</p></li> 
<li><u>Microsoft Developer's
Network Library</u>. April 2005. Microsoft Corporation, Redmond.
&lt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/&gt;
<p>
While somewhat unwieldly, the MSDN library is the best
reference library for kernel mode programming. It is constantly
updated, free to access online, and very accurate (sometimes so
accurate that developers unsuccessfully attempt to prove it
wrong). The best way to use this resource is through the search
function, simply searching for Kernel APIs, data structures, and
following links. Without this resource, either in it's online form, or on
CD, driver development would be much more difficult. However, the 
MSDN library can also be too big, and search results may yield
the correct topic in the wrong OS, or worse.
</p></li>
<li><u>Windows Hardware and Driver Central</u>. September
2005. Microsoft Corporation, 
Redmond. &lt;http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/&gt;
<p>
WHDC is the best place to download resources and read articles about
driver-related technologies; you'll also find information about WinHEC,
the Windows Hardware conference, as well as the next-gen driver
architecture for Windows, the Windows Driver Framework (WDF).
This is also the site from which one can order the DDK or
download debugging tools.</p></li>
<li><u>Open Systems Resources</u>.
September 2005. Amherst, New Hampshire. &lt;http://www.osronline.com/&gt;
<p>Outside of Microsoft resources, OSR is the place for
driver development articles, message boards, and IT training. It
also provides some utilities, such as the driver loader, to help
developers learn more about drivers. While the OSR site is
somewhat confusing, and has some articles that require a
subscription, it is a good place to browse and it often keeps up for the
public an online version of the DDK in plain text.</p></li>
<li><u>Windows Device Driver Development Kit</u>. Version 3790.1830.
Microsoft Corporation, Redmond.
<p>The DDK itself is not only an excellent resource, but is
required to actually compile production drivers for the Windows
family of operating systems. It comes complete with hypertext
documentation and a large selection of examples which provide
templates to start from when designing new drivers. The DDK contains
helpful utilities for driver writers as well, specifically the driver
verifier. It also provides build environments, at the time of this
writing, for Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003.</p></li>
<li>Microsoft newsgroup
&lt;microsoft.public.development.device.drivers&gt;, 2005.
<p>The driver development newsgroup hosted by Microsoft is the best way to
communicate with a large body of professionals, MVPs, and Microsoft
employees when asking questions about driver development. This
newsgroup is very active and has participants with a wide
variety of skill levels with Windows Drivers. It is also the
place to read about very nuanced issues that sometimes even the
DDK doesn't explain fully or well. The biggest criticism of this
newsgroup is that people often don't know the right question to
ask of its expert participants, so read through some of its archives 
before posting your own question.</p></li>
<li>Usenet newsgroup &lt;comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.nt.kernel-mode&gt;,
2005.
<p>Similar to the Microsoft-sponsored newsgroup on device drivers, this
its civillian cousin. Many questions and posters overlap between this and
the Microsoft newsgroup, but you may find more freedom in this environment
as well as more commercial developers. Be aware that this newsgroup also
is much more public, and often contains irrelevant posts, spam, and
ill-willed participants. It is best used as a last resort if you
can't find information elsewhere.</p></li> </ol>
