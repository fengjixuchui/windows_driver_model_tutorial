<h1>The I/O Request Packet</h1>
<h2>What's in an IRP?</h2>
<img src="images/irp.gif"/>
<p>An IRP contains every possible relevant piece of information regarding
an I/O request. Keep in mind that I/O request, in the sense of an IRP, may
not be actually I/O, but may be a device command or query that some lower
level driver (before the function driver itself) can answer. Most
importantly, IRPs contain the following information: addresses of
memory or buffers that contain information or must be filled with the
results of an I/O operation, the device flags (from the Device Object
before) which can specify things like buffered I/O, the main function
of the IRP (major function codes), a minor function code (if
applicable), a pointer to a routine that can cancel the IRP in
mid-processing, a status code for the IRP, an indication if the irp is 
pending and cannot be handled by a higher level driver, and many other 
important fields that contain valuable information.</p>
<h2>What the IRP Does</h2>
<p>Kernel mode code creates IRPs as a result of internal kernel operations
or on behalf of a user-mode component that requests I/O operations. Along
with an IRP, an array of <tt>IO_STACK_LOCATIONS</tt> is also created, one
entry per driver that will process the IRP, and each location contains
some more information about the IRP as well as a completion routine.
The array of IO stack locations is as vital to keep in mind as the
IRP itself. The I/O stack locations each contain the following
information: the IRP major function code, the minor function code,
flags, a union of parameter substructures, a pointer to the device
object, a pointer to a Kernel file object to which the I/O request is
directed, a completion routine pointer, and an arbitrary context value to
be passed to the completion routine.</p>

<p>While all the data structures inside an IRP and an array of IO stack
locations may sound like a mouthful, pay attention to the functionality
that this kind of system affords. Storing major function codes in each
array location allows an IRP to morph from one type of I/O request to
another as it travels down the stack. Pointers to buffers in an IRP allow
the kernel to automatically handle the messy process of allocating and
freeing non-paged system buffers for I/O for driver writers who are
uncomfortable with this process. The Status and Cancel fields allow IRPs
to be halted and expunged or suspended midway through the I/O system.
These structures and fields have evolved over time to include all sorts
of functionality as Microsoft's I/O subsystem requirements have grown and
changed.</p>

<h2>Types of IRPs</h2> 
<p>At this point, we must more fully limit our discussion to WDM filter
drivers. IRPs for DMA, interrupt driven I/O, and specific classes of
device vary in their behavior and processing so greatly that any driver
writer attempting to write a driver for such devices will have to learn
the very precise specifics of how XP handles the IRPs for her or his
device. For our WDM filter drivers, the IRP major function codes that we
will handle include IRP_MJ_CREATE and IRP_MJ_CLOSE, and
IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL.</p>
<h2>The Life of an IRP relevant to WDM drivers filtering Pointing
Devices</h2>
<p>For pointing devices that fit the USB specification, Microsoft provides
a miniport and port driver combination for Human Input Devices (HID) that
work as a function driver for HID devices. For mice, mouhid.sys and
mouclass.sys also work together to become a function Mouhid and Mouclass
work together to present a uniform HID mouse interface to the system, as
defined by Microsoft. This enabled applications to transparently handle
all kinds of mice that fit the specifications. Now, because a mouse an
input device, a special direct-call interface (a callback function) is
used to transfer information from whatever port driver to Mouclass.sys.
This facilitates using the Microsoft driver to handle all IRPs, regardless
of the underlying port driver. Because of stringent USB specifications,
all USB mice behave in a predicatable way, the HID port/miniport
combination know how to drive our device, and mouhid/mouclass present that
uniform interface to the rest of the system (if we were using a PS/2-port
mouse, we would see the i8042prt driver in place of the hidusb ones). 
</p> 
<p> Here is a diagram of how our mouse examples is placed in the driver 
stack:<br/>
<img src="images/mdevstack.gif"/>
</p>
<p>The callback mechanism is set up by an
<tt>IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL</tt> sent from the MouClass
layer down to the Mouhid layer. The IRP is completed by filling
it with a function pointer to mouclass/mouhid that hidusb/hidclass will
call in the case of input data to report. This input is delivered in the
context of a raw input thread (RIT) that the kernel assigns specifically
to reduce latency on input. While we could just drop IRPs that contain 
pointers to mouse input data structures from our filter driver, we
instead intercept the <TT>IRP_MJ_INTERNAL_DEVICE_CONTROL</tt>, fill
that IRP with our own callback function, and then have our callback
function call the original one in mouclass/mouhid.</p>
<p>The reason we can intercept this function pointer installation and make
our own is because the miniport/port driver combination uses the callback
mechanism to communicate. For most other IRPs, we will just simply pass
them down the stack to whatever is below our driver, and forget about
them. The queryattrs example driver is a special example in that it
creates a second IRP after installing a function pointer, and sends that
down for completion, and catches the IRP on the way back up the stack. 
 If the stacking order is still confusing, or you'd like to know more
about port/miniport combinations, the DDK includes mouclass.sys among
other related drivers (with full source), as well as more sample
device drivers or bus drivers that perform similar functions.</p> 
<p>Also, see figures 2-3, 2-4, and 2-6, in <u>Programming the
Microsoft Windows Driver Model</u> for a better
understanding of the WDM stacking struture.</p>
