<h1>WDM Driver Structure</h1>
<p>
The DDK has a default build script, which you should use, which specifies
the main entry point of your driver to the DriverEntry routine. Most
people don't go through the hassle of changing the entry point so they can
call their function(s) something other than the 'normal' names. You may
use arbitrary function names for the rest of the functions in your driver,
as you'll be filling a structure with pointers to them inside your
DriverEntry routine -- however, keeping names simple like the ones below
facilitates code reuse, and drivers contain a ton of boilerplate code.  
</p> 
<h3>Quick Overview, Graphically</h3>

<h3>Driver functions and what they do for our WDM Filter Driver</h3>
<p>While you may expect a blow-by-blow account of what each of
the following routines should do, the best place for that is browsing the
example filter drivers provided. You'll find that while these functions
exist in most drivers, there isn't a one-size-fits-all specification of
what a device-specific driver should do... or we wouldn't need device
drivers at all. I have, however, provided a textual description of what
each routine <b>should</b> do. Also, for each Add and Entry routine, there
<b>is</b> a corresponding Remove and Unload routine, though these exit
routines will not perform very much, if any, work for WDM drivers that
(must) fit the Plug and Play requirements.
 </p>
<ol>
<li>Basic Routines (These routines typically set up infrastructure
required by WDM by modifying some <a href="structure.html">Driver-related
Structures</a>)
	<ol type="a">
	<li><tt>NTSTATUS <strong><em>DriverEntry</em></strong> ( IN
PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject, IN  PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath );</tt>
	<p>This function's main job is to fill in function pointers to all
the other functions listed here. The most important pointer to set is 
the <tt>DriverExtension->AddDevice</tt> pointer.  The array of
pointers in <tt>DriverObject->MajorFunction[IRP_...]</tt> must also be
set. These functions (via the pointers you set) will be called to handle
various jobs as required by the I/O manager. This is also the place to
store a pointer to the <tt>DriverUnload</tt> routine, the opposite of
DriverEntry.
	</p></li>
	<li>
        <tt>
        NTSTATUS <strong><em>AddDevice</em></strong> (
        IN PDRIVER_OBJECT   Driver,
        IN PDEVICE_OBJECT   PDO
        );
        </tt>
	<p>
	Drivers are given a DriverObject (the FDO, or FiDO, which will
designate this driver) and a DeviceObject (the PDO) as arguments to this
routine. Here, Drivers must create a device object to represent the
physical device they manage, initialize the device extension and fill in
flags with device-specific values, and call
<tt>IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStack</tt> to have the I/O Manager link the
device object into the stack.
	</p></li>
        </ol></li>
<li>I/O Control Routines (These routines typically create, complete,
modify, or otherwise handle <a href="irp.html">I/O Request Packets</a>)
	<ol type="a">
	<li><tt>BOOLEAN <strong><em>OnInterrupt</em></strong> (
IN PKINTERRUPT InterruptObject, IN PDEVICE_EXTENSION pdx );</tt> <p>Used
for the fast handling of an interrupt (clear the interrupt and queue a dpc
as fast as possible) when the device needs to notify the driver that some
operation has completed or occurred. We won't use this for our
filter driver, but it is important enough to be mentioned anyway.</p></li>
	<li><tt>
VOID <strong><em>DpcForIsr</em></strong> ( IN PKDPC Dpc, IN PDEVICE_OBJECT
fdo, IN PIRP Irp, IN PDEVICE_EXTENSION pdx );
</tt>
<p>The function that probably completes the I/O
request (packets) that were queued for completion during the ISR. 
We won't see these in our filter driver either, since we won't
be the driver primarily responsible for completing I/O requests.</p></li>
	<li>There are other I/O routines for DMA Adapater control and IRP
queuing, but they won't appear in WDM often and certainly won't appear in
our samples.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Dispatch Routines (These routines typically create, complete,
modify, or otherwise handle <a href="irp.html">I/O Request Packets</a>)
	<ol type="a">
	<li><tt>NTSTAUS <strong><em>DispatchPnp</em></strong> (
IN PDEVICE_OBJECT fdo, IN PIRP Irp );</tt><p>Handles plug and play events
that are usually sent from the PNP Manager to the driver. WDM Drivers are
required to handle PNP events.</p></li>
	<li><tt>NTSTAUS <strong><em>DispatchPower</em></strong> (
IN PDEVICE_OBJECT fdo, IN PIRP Irp );</tt><p>Handles power manager queries
and requests. WDM Drivers are required to handle these kinds of queries
and requests.</p></li>
	<li><tt>NTSTATUS <strong><em>DispatchWmi</em></strong> ( IN
PDEVICE_OBJECT fido, IN PIRP Irp );</tt><p>Handles Windows Management
Instrumentation actions that occur from a user that is using WMI to
manage devices. We won't be focusing on this aspect of Drivers, as WMI
is an entire other architecture for managing Windows systems.</p></li>
	<li>DispatchRead &amp; DispatchWrite <p>These two
routines are called when the driver/device is called upon to
perform I/O. I've omitted the function prototypes because, as you 
may have guessed from the list above, most dispatch routines have
identical prototypes; one can even use a single generic dispatch
routine for every dispatch need.</p></li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>As this guide focuses on WDM filter drivers, most actual I/O, pnp, and
power
requests will simply be passed down to the device object below the current
one, and forgotten about. WDM filter drivers will contain the bulk of
their functionality in DriverEntry, AddDevice, DriverUnload, and IRP
handling routines that catch returned-data passing up the stack towards
the I/O requestor and modify it. </p> 
<p>
The sample annotated drivers should make a lot more sense after this
section. In effect, they get in between the original callback mechanism
used by XP's thread for polling for input data. This is probably a good
time in the guild to explore the sample annotated drivers.
