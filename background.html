<h1>Background/Architecture</h1>
<p>To begin understanding and creating device drivers, one must first
understand the architecture under which these device drivers will
execute. The following diagram is a simplified overall view of the
Windows XP Architecture relevant to Driver Development. It is very
important to remember that many other Executive (read: XP Kernel)
services are not shown in this diagram, but still may affect drivers.</p>

<h2>Windows Applications</h2>
<p>Using the Win32 API (User Mode API), Applications make calls to the 
Win32 Subsystem, which is a composed of a linked library that 'traps'
into kernel mode. Next, the user mode API call is mapped into a System 
Service Dispatcher function call; in the case of most device drivers,
this means that the dispatcher calls an I/O Manager function. The I/O
Manager creates and allocates space for a new I/O Request Packet
(IRP) structure instance. This IRP is passed to the relevant device
drivers; these drivers then use the hardware abstraction layer (HAL) calls
to read bytes directly from the hardware.</p> 
<a name="hal" />
<h2>Hardware Abstraction Layer</h2>
<p>Affectionately known as the HAL, this is a collection of
subroutines that varies for different hardware configurations.
Collectively, these routines present the same hardware access
interface to the kernel and device drivers, effectively isolating
the OS from platform-specific hardware differences.</p> 
<a name="dispatcher"/>
<h2>System Service Dispatcher</h2>
<p>The system service dispatcher is in charge of handling interrupts,
exceptions, and system service calls. Depending on the HAL, most platforms
contain an instruction that causes a 'trap' that initiates a transition
into Kernel mode. On Intel x86 Pentium II and later, this
instruction is called 'sysenter,' and there two registers EAX (system call
#) and EBX (pointer to parameter list) reserved for trapping into kernel
mode. In order to actually handle these calls, the system also stores (at 
boot) a function pointer to the dispatcher in a special register reserved for
system calls. ( <a href="intspri.html">more on interrupts and windows
scheduling related to drivers</a> )</p>
<a name="iomanager" />
<h2>The I/O System (and the I/O Manager)</h2>
<p>The Windows XP I/O System is intended to manage hardware devices and
provide access to them from Applications and the system itself. This
system is packet driven: at its core are the I/O Request Packet (IRP) and  
the I/O Manager. To complete I/O requests, these IRPs are passed around
between different components of the I/O system until the request is
complete (the rest of this guide will elaborate of much of the I/O system 
).</p>

<h2>Device Driver Architecture</h2>
<p>
Windows supports a wide variety of device-types and programming
environments. Drivers fall into two major categories: User-Mode and
Kernel-Mode. Printer drivers and virtual device drivers are two main types
of user-mode drivers. This guide focuses on the other, probably larger,
category of kernel-contained drivers. This second type is
dynamically linked into the OS kernel itself. Kernel mode drivers are of
many types, including but not limited to file system drivers, network
device drivers, video adapater drivers, input device drivers, and
"protocol" drivers.

<h2>Other Kernel Services</h2> 
<p>
The Windows Kernel provides many other services to user-mode program
programs as well as processes that promote the overall "health" of the
system. These "services" include such things as File System caches, Object
Manager, Security Reference Monitor, Virtual Memory, Process &amp; Thread
Management and Scheduling, Configuration Manager (the Registry), Local
Procedure Call facilty, and more.</p>
<p>The Windows Kernel also has a ridiculously large number of supporting
functions that also provide things such as Unicode string handling and
synchronization objects. It may be appropriate here to note
that non-plug and plug drivers in the above section may also provide extra
kernel functionality in the form of services like the implementation of
network protocols.</p>
